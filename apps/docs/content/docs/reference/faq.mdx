This page answers the most common questions about atl.chat — what it is, how to connect, how to contribute, and how to handle everyday operational tasks.

## General

### What is atl.chat?

atl.chat is the unified chat infrastructure for the [All Things Linux](https://allthingslinux.org) community. It provides IRC (via [UnrealIRCd](/docs/services/irc) and [Atheme](/docs/services/atheme)), XMPP (via [Prosody](/docs/services/xmpp)), a Discord bridge, and web-based clients — all running as a single Docker Compose stack in one monorepo.

### How do the services relate to each other?

UnrealIRCd handles IRC connections and Atheme provides nickname/channel registration on top of it (they share a Docker network namespace). Prosody runs the XMPP side independently. The [Bridge](/docs/services/bridge) relays messages between Discord, IRC, and XMPP so users on any platform see the same conversations. [The Lounge](/docs/services/thelounge) and [Gamja](/docs/reference/glossary) are web IRC clients that connect to UnrealIRCd, and the [WebPanel](/docs/services/webpanel) gives operators a browser-based admin interface via UnrealIRCd's JSON-RPC API.

### Is atl.chat open source?

Yes. The entire monorepo — server configs, bridge code, web apps, documentation, and infrastructure — is open source. You can fork it, run your own instance, or contribute back via pull requests.

## Connecting

### How do I connect to IRC?

You have several options:

1. **Desktop IRC client** (HexChat, irssi, WeeChat) — connect to `irc.atl.tools` on port `6697` with TLS enabled.
2. **The Lounge** — open the web client in your browser (port `9000` in dev, or the public URL in production). You need an account created by an operator (`just lounge add`).
3. **Gamja** — a lightweight web client (planned, not yet active).

See the [IRC overview](/docs/services/irc) for full connection details.

### How do I connect to XMPP?

Use any XMPP client (Conversations on Android, Gajim on desktop, Moxxy on iOS) and connect to the Prosody server on port `5222` with TLS. Browser-based access is available via BOSH (port `5280`) or WebSocket. See the [XMPP overview](/docs/services/xmpp) for details.

### Can I use Discord instead?

Yes. The [Bridge](/docs/services/bridge) relays messages between Discord, IRC, and XMPP channels automatically. You chat on Discord as usual and your messages appear on IRC/XMPP (and vice versa). No extra setup is needed on the user side.

### How do I register my IRC nickname?

After connecting, register with NickServ:

```text
/msg NickServ REGISTER <password> <email>
```

Then identify on future connections:

```text
/msg NickServ IDENTIFY <password>
```

Most modern clients support SASL authentication, which identifies you automatically at connect time. See the [Atheme operations page](/docs/services/atheme/operations) for more NickServ commands.

## Contributing

### How do I contribute to atl.chat?

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Follow the [local development guide](/docs/getting-started/local-development) to get the stack running.
3. Create a feature branch, make your changes, and open a pull request.

The project uses [Conventional Commits](/docs/development/contributing), pre-commit hooks (`just lint`), and automated tests (`just test`). See the full [contributing guide](/docs/development/contributing) for branch naming, code style, and review expectations.

### What languages and tools does the project use?

| Area | Language / Tool |
|---|---|
| IRC server config | UnrealIRCd config format, Lua scripts |
| IRC services | Atheme (C, configured via template) |
| XMPP server | Prosody (Lua configuration) |
| Bridge | Python |
| Web app and docs | TypeScript, Next.js, MDX |
| Infrastructure | Docker Compose, bash scripts, `just` |
| Linting | ruff (Python), Biome (TypeScript), luacheck (Lua), shellcheck (bash) |

See the [contributing page](/docs/development/contributing) for code style guides per language.

### How do I run the tests?

```bash
# Unit tests (fast, no Docker needed)
uv run pytest tests/unit/

# Bridge tests (fast, no Docker needed)
uv run pytest apps/bridge/tests/

# All tests
just test-all
```

See the [testing guide](/docs/development/testing) for the full test directory layout, fixtures, and CI integration.

## Operations

### How do I add a new user to The Lounge?

```bash
just lounge add <username>
```

You will be prompted for a password. The user can then log in to The Lounge web interface. See [The Lounge operations](/docs/services/thelounge/operations) for listing, resetting, and removing users.

### How do I rotate secrets and passwords?

Generate new values for sensitive environment variables (anything containing `PASSWORD`, `TOKEN`, `SECRET`, or `KEY` in `.env`), then restart the affected services:

```bash
# Generate a secure random value
openssl rand -base64 32

# After updating .env, restart the stack
just prod
```

See the [security page](/docs/operations/security) for per-variable generation commands and the full credential rotation procedure.

### How do I check if services are healthy?

Quick health checks for each service:

```bash
# IRC — verify TLS connection
openssl s_client -connect localhost:6697 -servername irc.localhost </dev/null 2>/dev/null | head -5

# XMPP — check BOSH endpoint
curl -sf http://localhost:5280/http-bind

# The Lounge — HTTP health
curl -sf http://localhost:9000

# Container status
just status
```

See the [monitoring page](/docs/operations/monitoring) for comprehensive health checks, log inspection patterns, and alerting strategies.

### How do I update or upgrade services?

1. Back up persistent data (`data/` directory) — see the [backups guide](/docs/operations/backups).
2. Pull the latest changes: `git pull`.
3. Rebuild and restart: `just build` then `just prod`.
4. Verify services are running: `just status`.

For TLS certificate renewal and post-renewal hooks (UnrealIRCd rehash, Prosody reload), see the [SSL/TLS page](/docs/operations/ssl-tls).

### Where do I find logs?

```bash
# Follow all service logs
just logs

# Follow a specific service
just logs unrealircd
just logs prosody
just logs bridge
```

Docker Compose logs are the primary source. In dev mode, [Dozzle](http://localhost:8082) provides a browser-based log viewer. See [monitoring](/docs/operations/monitoring) for log inspection patterns and filtering tips.
