description: Overview of the atl.chat XMPP stack powered by Prosody.
---

atl.chat's XMPP service is provided by Prosody, a lightweight, extensible XMPP server written in Lua. It supports standard XMPP clients via STARTTLS/TLS, server-to-server federation, and BOSH/WebSocket transports for web clients.

## Components

### Prosody

Prosody handles all XMPP traffic. It is configured via `prosody.cfg.lua` and environment variables, with modules managed through a `source/` directory (for compiled modules) and an `enabled/` directory (for active modules).

### Bridge integration

The bridge connects to Prosody via an XMPP component connection. The component interface allows the bridge to appear as a separate subdomain (e.g., `bridge.atl.chat`) within the XMPP network.

> **Note:** The `component_interfaces` configuration may need adjustment if the bridge container cannot connect. If you experience connectivity issues, verify that the component interface binds to `0.0.0.0` (or the Docker network interface) rather than `127.0.0.1` in `prosody.cfg.lua`.
