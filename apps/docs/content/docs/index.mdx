description: Unified chat infrastructure combining IRC, XMPP, Discord, and a web interface.
---

atl.chat documentation covers everything you need to deploy, operate, and contribute to a self-hosted unified chat platform that bridges IRC, XMPP, and Discord into a single community experience.

## What is atl.chat?

atl.chat is an open-source monorepo that provides unified chat infrastructure for the [All Things Linux](https://allthingslinux.org) community. It combines an IRC server ([UnrealIRCd](/docs/services/irc) 6.x with [Atheme](/docs/services/atheme) services), an XMPP server ([Prosody](/docs/services/xmpp)), a [Discord↔IRC↔XMPP bridge](/docs/services/bridge), web IRC clients ([The Lounge](/docs/services/thelounge), Gamja), an admin panel ([WebPanel](/docs/services/webpanel)), and a Next.js [web application](/docs/services/web) — all orchestrated with Docker Compose and managed through the [`just` task runner](/docs/reference/glossary).

The project lets community members participate from whichever protocol they prefer while keeping conversations synchronised across all platforms.

## Project status

> **Note:** atl.chat is currently v0.1.0 alpha and not yet production-ready. APIs and configuration formats may change without notice.
