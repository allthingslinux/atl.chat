title: Port Registry
description: Complete port registry for all atl.chat services, verified against compose files.
---

This page lists every port used by atl.chat services, verified against the current `compose.yaml` and `infra/compose/*.yaml` files. All host-side ports are configurable via environment variables in `.env`.

## IRC stack

Defined in `infra/compose/irc.yaml`.

| Port | Env Variable | Service | Protocol | Bind address | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `6697` | `IRC_TLS_PORT` | UnrealIRCd | TCP | `ATL_CHAT_IP` | IRC over TLS — primary client connection |
| `8000` | `IRC_WEBSOCKET_PORT` | UnrealIRCd | TCP | `ATL_CHAT_IP` | IRC WebSocket for web clients |
| `8600` | `IRC_RPC_PORT` | UnrealIRCd | TCP | `ATL_CHAT_IP` | JSON-RPC API (used by WebPanel and tooling) |
| `6900` | `IRC_SERVER_PORT` | UnrealIRCd | TCP | `ATL_CHAT_IP` | Server-to-server links |
| `8081` | `ATHEME_HTTPD_PORT` | Atheme | TCP | `ATL_CHAT_IP` | Atheme HTTP API (Atheme shares the IRC server's network namespace) |
| `8080` | `WEBPANEL_PORT` | WebPanel | TCP | `0.0.0.0` | UnrealIRCd admin web panel |

The five UnrealIRCd and Atheme ports bind to `ATL_CHAT_IP` (default `127.0.0.1`). The WebPanel port binds to all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) and does not use `ATL_CHAT_IP`.

Atheme uses `network_mode: service:atl-irc-server`, so it shares the IRC server's network stack. The Atheme uplink port (`6901`) is internal to that shared namespace and not exposed to the host.

## XMPP stack

Defined in `infra/compose/xmpp.yaml`.

| Port | Env Variable | Service | Protocol | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `5222` | `PROSODY_C2S_PORT` | Prosody | TCP | XMPP client-to-server (STARTTLS) |
| `5223` | `PROSODY_C2S_DIRECT_TLS_PORT` | Prosody | TCP | XMPP client-to-server (Direct TLS) |
| `5269` | `PROSODY_S2S_PORT` | Prosody | TCP | XMPP server-to-server federation |
| `5270` | `PROSODY_S2S_DIRECT_TLS_PORT` | Prosody | TCP | XMPP server-to-server (Direct TLS) |
| `5280` | `PROSODY_HTTP_PORT` | Prosody | TCP | HTTP — BOSH and WebSocket endpoints |
| `5000` | `PROSODY_PROXY65_PORT` | Prosody | TCP | SOCKS5 bytestream proxy for file transfers |
| `5281` | `PROSODY_HTTPS_PORT` | Nginx (XMPP) | TCP | HTTPS reverse proxy for Prosody |

## Web clients

| Port | Env Variable | Service | Compose File | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `9000` | `THELOUNGE_PORT` | The Lounge | `infra/compose/thelounge.yaml` | Web IRC client (private mode, requires user account) |

## Bridge

Defined in `infra/compose/bridge.yaml`. The bridge service does not expose any host ports — it connects outbound to IRC, XMPP, and Discord over the `atl-chat` Docker network and the internet.

## Dev-only services

Available when running `just dev` (activates the `dev` Docker Compose profile).

| Port | Env Variable | Service | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `8082` | `DOZZLE_PORT` | Dozzle | Docker log viewer (container port `8080` mapped to host `8082`) |

## TURN/STUN (standalone)

Deployed separately via `infra/turn-standalone/compose.yaml` using host networking. Not part of the main `compose.yaml` stack.

| Port | Protocol | Service | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `3478` | TCP/UDP | Coturn | STUN/TURN relay |
| `5349` | TCP | Coturn | TURNS (TLS) |
| `49152–49202` | UDP | Coturn | Media relay port range |

## Services not in Docker Compose

These services run outside the Docker stack during development:

| Port | Service | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `3000` | Next.js web app | Run locally with `pnpm dev` in `apps/web/` |

## Customising ports

Every host-side port is controlled by an environment variable in `.env`. To change a port, set the variable before starting the stack:

```bash
# Example: move IRC TLS to port 6698
IRC_TLS_PORT=6698
```

The IRC stack ports also respect `ATL_CHAT_IP` (default `127.0.0.1`), which controls the bind address. Set it to `0.0.0.0` to listen on all interfaces in production.

See the [environment variables reference](/docs/reference/environment-variables) for the full list.
